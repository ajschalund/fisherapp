Muffins are not as easy to get right as one might think. Too dry, too dense, to sugary—these are all problems that one can encounter when trying to bake the perfect muffin. This blueberry muffin recipe however, makes them just right—fluffy and full of blueberries—and still good the next day!</a></p>

                      <p>If you are using frozen berries, you can use them frozen, just separate them and toss them in flour to coat. Your cooking time may need to increase by a few minutes.</p>
<p>Some brands of sour cream are much thicker than others. Feel free to dilute the sour cream with a little water if you think it's too thick. You can substitute the sour cream with plain yogurt; if you do, you likely will not need both tablespoons of added milk.</p>

                    <h3>Method</h3>
                    <div itemprop="recipeInstructions"><p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15131" src="http://www.simplyrecipes.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/07/blueberry-muffins-1.jpg" alt="coat blueberries with flour" width="294" height="196" /></p>
<p><b>1 </b>Place the blueberries in a bowl. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of flour over them and gently toss to coat. (The flour will help keep the blueberries from sinking in the muffin as it cooks.)</p>
<p><b>2</b> Preheat your oven to 400°F with a rack in the lower middle. In a mixing bowl, whisk together the dry ingredients—the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15130" src="http://www.simplyrecipes.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/07/blueberry-muffins-2.jpg" alt="whisk together dry ingredients" width="294" height="196" /> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15129" src="http://www.simplyrecipes.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/07/blueberry-muffins-3.jpg" alt="whisk together wet ingredients" width="294" height="196" /></p>
<p><b>3</b> In a large mixing bowl, place the sour cream, sugar, eggs, milk, melted butter, lemon zest, and vanilla (the wet ingredients). Whisk together until smooth.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15128" src="http://www.simplyrecipes.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/07/blueberry-muffins-4.jpg" alt="add dry ingredients to wet" width="294" height="196" /> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15127" src="http://www.simplyrecipes.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/07/blueberry-muffins-5.jpg" alt="mix until just combined" width="294" height="196" /></p>
<p><b>4</b> Add the dry ingredients to the butter/sugar/egg mixture a third at a time and mix until just incorporated.  Do not over mix!</p>
<p><b>5</b> Gently fold the blueberries into the mixture.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15126" src="http://www.simplyrecipes.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/07/blueberry-muffins-6.jpg" alt="gently fold in blueberries" width="294" height="196" /> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15125" src="http://www.simplyrecipes.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/07/blueberry-muffins-7.jpg" alt="fill in muffin cups" width="294" height="196" /></p>
<p><b>6</b> Use a standard 12-well muffin pan. Place a muffin liner in each well of the muffin pan, or if you don't have muffin liners, grease the inside of the muffin pan wells with vegetable oil or butter. Distribute the dough equally among the cups. You'll need to fill them very high to use all of the batter in 12 muffins, which is fine. They won't spill. If you still have too much dough, start filling another tin.</p>
<p><b>7</b> Place the muffins in the oven and bake at 400°F until the muffins are golden brown, about 20 minutes. (If the muffins are getting too brown, tent with foil.) Test with a bamboo skewer to make sure the centers of the muffins are done. Let the muffins cool in the muffin pan for 2 to 3 minutes, then remove them from the pan. Let cool another 10 minutes before eating.</p>
